# hello-world
The first repository I'll create!

I just realized I have now left my final summer vacation of my life behind, feeling slightly sad. I hope that the future is fun though, so that I never even miss these times! I enjoy pizzas a lot (even though I am vegetarian) and I have a taste for spices. Good day to whoever reads this!
